# Machine Learning Algorithms for DDoS Detection and Mitigation

## Introduction

In the directory `ML_Algorithms`, I have implemented several Controller files, each dedicated to a specific machine learning algorithm used for testing in the context of detecting and mitigating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

## Algorithms Overview

### Random Forest DDoS Controller

The `RandomForestDDoSController.py` file contains the implementation of a Random Forest-based approach to identify and reduce the impact of DDoS attacks. This algorithm leverages ensemble learning for robust detection.

### Support Vector Machine DDoS Controller

For Support Vector Machine-based DDoS detection, refer to the `SVMDDoSController.py` file. SVM is employed to classify network traffic and recognize patterns indicative of DDoS activities.

### Neural Network DDoS Controller

The `NeuralNetworkDDoSController.py` file implements a Neural Network-based solution for DDoS detection. Neural networks excel at learning complex patterns, making them suitable for identifying sophisticated attack patterns.

## Usage

To utilize these algorithms, simply import the respective Controller file based on the machine learning approach you wish to employ. Adjust the parameters as needed and integrate the solution into your DDoS mitigation strategy.

## Conclusion

These machine learning algorithms serve as valuable tools in the ongoing battle against DDoS attacks. Feel free to explore and adapt them to meet the specific requirements of your network security architecture.

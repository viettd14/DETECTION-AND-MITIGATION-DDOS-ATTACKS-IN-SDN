## Abstract
<a name="abstract"></a>

The escalating risks to network security, stemming from the continual evolution of network infrastructure and application systems, have significantly impacted system availability, with Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks standing out as a particularly disruptive threat capable of overwhelming and even incapacitating systems. In response, this study introduces a comprehensive system designed to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks within Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). Our proposed solution involves a multi-modules architecture operating as an Intrusion Prevent System (IPS), strategically engineered for seamless integration into the Controller device. The system's functionality includes the periodic extraction of multiple parameters from flow entries on the OpenFlow switch, complemented by machine learning (ML) models, enabling the identification of abnormal packets infiltrating the system. Upon detecting an attack, the controller promptly dispatches policies to the OpenFlow switch, initiating the removal of malicious packets. This autonomous system employs common machine learning algorithms and real-time processes to detect and counteract attacks on OpenFlow Switches. The study evaluates the systemâ€™s performance using four distinct algorithms such as Decision Tree(DT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The CIC-DDOS2019 input dataset [1] is used to evaluate machine learning algorithms in detecting DDoS attacks, experimental results show that the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm exhibits high F1 scores. highest with 99.87%
